# Project: Movies
### Code lib Folder

The network graph script is Movie_Graph3.ipynb. You can open it in Jupyter or other python notebook.

The final report should be presented as a html form since we embeded some D3 images into our report. All the images in this file are related to loading our report (Oscars_Final_Report.html). We need all the images in the same work directory as the html in order to run the html. So it may seem a little messy in this file. But the good thing is that you can download all the files and try to run it by yourself.

The codes for Shiny App are in the Shinyapp file.

The lib directory contains various files with function definitions (but only function definitions - no code that actually runs).
